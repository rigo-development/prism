# ===== DATABASE CONFIGURATION =====
# For local development with SQLite (default):
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db

# For production with PostgreSQL (Vercel/Neon):
# PRISMA_DATABASE_URL: Connection pooler URL (used for queries)
#   - Used by your application for database queries
#   - Goes through a connection pooler (better for serverless)
#   - On Vercel, this is automatically set as POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL
PRISMA_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require

# POSTGRES_URL: Direct database URL (used for migrations)
#   - Used by Prisma for migrations and schema operations
#   - Direct connection to the database (required for some operations)
#   - On Vercel, this is automatically set as POSTGRES_URL
# 
# NOTE: For simple setups without a connection pooler, both URLs can be identical.
# Vercel Postgres provides both automatically.
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require
